CONTEXT:
  domain: Enterprise Application Resource Management
  scale: Multi-threaded concurrent processing
  constraints: 
    - Prevent thread leaks during application lifecycle
    - Ensure graceful shutdown of executor threads
    - Maintain zero resource leaks in production
  team: Spring Boot developers managing concurrent operations
  integration: Spring lifecycle management, JVM shutdown hooks
  REQUIREMENTS:
  functional:
    - Properly shutdown ExecutorService on application termination
    - Complete all running tasks before shutdown
    - Reject new tasks during shutdown phase
    - Clean up thread pool resources
  non_functional:
    performance: Shutdown within configurable timeout (default 30s)
    security: No dangling threads with sensitive data
    scalability: Support multiple executor services
    reliability: 100% resource cleanup guarantee
  compliance: Thread-safe shutdown, Spring Boot lifecycle compliance
  ARCHITECTURE:
  pattern: Spring Lifecycle Management Pattern
  style: Component-based with lifecycle hooks
  layers:
    - presentation: N/A (backend service)
    - application: Service layer with @PreDestroy hooks
    - domain: Executor management logic
    - infrastructure: Thread pool configuration
  data_flow: Graceful task completion → Thread termination → Resource cleanup
  FRAMEWORK:
  core:
    language: Java 17
    framework: Spring Boot 3.x
  lifecycle:
    hooks: @PreDestroy, DisposableBean, SmartLifecycle
    timeout: spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase
  monitoring: Thread dump analysis, metrics
  deployment: Kubernetes-aware graceful shutdown
