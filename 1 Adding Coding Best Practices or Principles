#### Java - Apply SOLID Principles
```
Refactor this Java code to follow SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each class should have one job
- Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable
- Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces over one general
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Also apply:
- Proper exception handling
- Input validation
- Logging with SLF4J
- Unit test considerations
