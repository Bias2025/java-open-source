 * ENHANCED CRAFT METHOD FOR COMPREHENSIVE YAGNI PRINCIPLE REFACTORING
 * This enterprise-grade prompt generates COMPLETE, production-ready minimization solution with:
 * 
 * COMPREHENSIVE SPECULATION ANALYSIS:
 * - Systematic identification of unused methods, classes, and interfaces
 * - Business logic speculation detection across different layers and components
 * - Configuration and feature flag speculation analysis for unused options
 * - Validation and error handling speculation for unimplemented scenarios
 * - Data transformation and mapping speculation for unused data flows
 * - Database schema speculation for unused tables and columns
 * - API endpoint speculation for unimplemented client requirements
 * - Utility method speculation across different service classes
 * 
 * ADVANCED ELIMINATION TECHNIQUES:
 * - Dead code detection and removal with dependency analysis
 * - Unused parameter elimination with method signature simplification
 * - Speculative interface method removal with contract minimization
 * - Over-engineered inheritance flattening with concrete implementations
 * - Generic type parameter reduction for single-use scenarios
 * - Design pattern elimination where direct implementation suffices
 * - Framework abstraction removal for direct library usage
 * - Configuration option removal for unused feature toggles
 * 
 * MINIMAL DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * - Direct factory implementations instead of abstract factories
 * - Concrete strategy implementations instead of strategy interfaces
 * - Simple method calls instead of command pattern overhead
 * - Direct object access instead of facade pattern complexity
 * - Immediate execution instead of proxy pattern indirection
 * - Direct notification instead of observer pattern infrastructure
 * - Sequential processing instead of chain of responsibility overhead

 * 
 * PARAMETERIZED PLACEHOLDERS - Replace with your specific values:
 * - [PROJECT_NAME] → Your project name (ECommerceSystem, BankingPlatform, HealthcarePortal, etc.)
 * - [DOMAIN_NAME] → Your business domain (ecommerce, banking, healthcare, logistics, etc.)
 * - [BUSINESS_PURPOSE] → Your business purpose (online retail, financial services, patient care, etc.)
 * - [ENTITY_NAME] → Your core entity (Product, Account, Patient, Order, etc.)
 * - [COMPANY_NAME] → Your company name (TechCorp, FinanceInc, HealthTech, etc.)
 * - [MODULE_NAME] → Your module name (service, repository, controller, utility, etc.)
 * - [PACKAGE_NAME] → Your package structure (com.company.project, org.enterprise.system, etc.)
 * 
 * YAGNI REFACTORING CUSTOMIZATIONS:
 * - Identify your specific speculative code patterns and over-engineered features
 * - Define your current requirement boundaries and actual usage validation
 * - Specify your minimal functionality goals and essential feature identification
