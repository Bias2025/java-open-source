      - Zero layout shift during resize
      - Debounced resize handlers (16ms threshold)
      - Lazy-loaded responsive images
    accessibility:
      - ARIA landmarks for all screen sizes
      - Focus management across breakpoints
      - Screen reader announcements for layout changes
    scalability:
      - Component reusability across projects
      - Theme-able responsive utilities
      - RTL/LTR support
      
  compliance:
    - WCAG 2.1 AA standards
    - Material Design responsive guidelines
    - iOS/Android native app parity
