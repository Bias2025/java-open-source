    - NULL-safe data access patterns
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Large payload streaming (>100MB)
    - Audit trail for all operations
  non_functional:
    performance: 
      - Query response < 100ms for 95th percentile
      - Support 10K concurrent queries
      - Zero full table scans
    security:
      - Input sanitization
      - SQL injection prevention
      - Encrypted data at rest/transit
    scalability:
      - Horizontal scaling ready
      - Database connection pooling
      - Circuit breaker patterns
    reliability:
      - Automatic retry with jitter
      - Graceful degradation
      - Transaction rollback safety

ARCHITECTURE:
  pattern: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
  style: Microservices with Event Sourcing
  layers:
    presentation: REST API with HATEOAS
    application: Service layer with transaction boundaries
    domain: Rich domain models with validation
    infrastructure: Repository pattern with specifications
  data_flow: 
    - CQRS for read/write separation
    - Event sourcing for audit
    - Pagination with cursor-based navigation

FRAMEWORK:
  core:
    language: Java 17
    framework: Spring Boot 3.2.x
  persistence:
    database: PostgreSQL 15
    orm: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
    migration: Flyway
    connection_pool: HikariCP
  caching: 
    - Redis for query results
    - Caffeine for local cache
  messaging: Apache Kafka
  monitoring: 
    - Micrometer + Prometheus
    - Distributed tracing with Zipkin
  deployment: Kubernetes with auto-scaling

TECHNOLOGY:
  null_safety:
    - Optional<T> for nullable returns
    - @NonNull/@Nullable annotations
    - Validation framework integration
  pagination:
    - Spring Data Pageable
    - Cursor-based for large datasets
    - Index optimization strategies
  retry_mechanism:
    - Spring Retry with @Retryable
    - Circuit breaker with Resilience4j
    - Custom retry templates
  performance:
    - Database indexes on query columns
    - Projection queries for read optimization
    - Batch processing for bulk operations
  large_payload_handling:
    - Streaming with @ResponseBody
    - Chunked transfer encoding
    - Async processing with CompletableFuture

TESTING:
  unit: JUnit 5 + Mockito
  integration: TestContainers with PostgreSQL
  performance: JMeter for load testing
  security: OWASP dependency check
  coverage: 90% minimum with SonarQube
